# Machine Learning Course Repository

This repository contains code and resources related to the labs for the CPSC_5616-Machine Learning/Deep Learning course(2024W) at Laurentian University. The course covers a wide range of topics in machine learning, deep learning, neural network and more.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to provide a centralized location for accessing and managing course materials, including lecture notes, assignments, and project specifications.

## Jupyter Notebook Setup

To run the code provided in the Jupyter Notebook files within this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Airmacho/CPSC_5616_MLDL.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the directory containing the Jupyter Notebook file for the specific assignment or project you want to run.

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

4. In your web browser, open the Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb) and execute the code cells sequentially.

## Assignment 1: Linear Regression

The first assignment focuses on implementing linear regression, a fundamental technique in machine learning, using Python and Jupyter Notebook. In this assignment, you will:

- Load and preprocess a dataset
- Implement the gradient descent algorithm to optimize the parameters of a linear regression model with one variable
- Evaluate the performance of the model using appropriate test cases
- Visualize the results and analyze the relationship between input features and target variable

To access the assignment notebook, navigate to the `Assignment_1` directory and open the `C1_W2_Linear_Regression.ipynb` file.

## Assignment 2: Linear Regression

The second assignment focuses on using neural networks for handwritten digit recognition, specifically digits 0-9.

- Introduced the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function for non-linearity in neural networks.
- Utilized the softmax function to convert output values into a probability distribution for multiclass classification.
- Implemented a neural network for recognizing handwritten digits 0-9 using TensorFlow.
- Worked with a dataset of 5000 training examples of 20x20 grayscale images unrolled into a 400-dimensional vector.
- Demonstrated creating a NumPy implementation of the softmax function for converting values to a probability distribution.
- Examined the neural network model representation with two dense layers and an output layer tailored for digit recognition.
